## What it doesn't have (but the official does)
  - Song cover (images)
  - Downloader
  - Notification player controller
  - Library viewer (only can controll open tabs)

## Why use this and not the official clementine android app
Although the official clementine app is featured and functional
it lacks a direct interface from where you can control all the
usual operations one would want from a player such as the playlists list, songs
list, etc from one place. This app does that. Basically, is a more ergonomic alternative
